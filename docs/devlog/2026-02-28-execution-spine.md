# What Works

I should be able to now register tools cleanly and make approvals as needed.

The gateway design confused me; also debugging the approval insertion was a PITA.

I learned about tool registration.  Most of this was just copy-pasting what chatgpt 5.2 recommended.

# Next Goals

Stand up Gcal in read-only mode.
Stand up the Sonos approval tool so I can start playing music remotely from my phone.
